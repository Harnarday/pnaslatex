PNAS latex and LyX class/template files

## Introduction

PNAS accepss [latex submissions](http://www.pnas.org/site/authors/LaTex.xhtml) and provides a
latex class and style files for this purpose. Unfortunately it is very hard to use these to 
produce decent output. After quite a bit of hacking James Manton in the lab gave up on trying to
use them and re-engineered from scratch to give a much more satisfactory output.
